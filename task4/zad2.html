                Water is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance, which
                is the
                main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms. It is vital for
                all known
                forms of life, even though it provides neither food, energy, nor organic micronutrients. Its chemical
                formula,
                H2O,indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by
                covalent
                bonds. The hydrogen atoms are attached to the oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45Â°. "Water" is the name of
                the
                liquid state of H2O at standard conditions for temperature and pressure. A number of natural states of
                water
                exist. Itforms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog. Clouds consist of
                suspended
                droplets of water and ice, its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline ice may precipitate in the
                form of
                snow. The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor. Water covers about 70.9% of the Earth's
                surface,
                mostly in seas and oceans. Small portions of water occurgroundwater (1.7%), in the glaciers and the ice
                caps
                of Antarctica and Greenland (1.7%), and in the air as vapor, clouds (consisting of ice and liquid water
                suspended in air), and precipitation (0.001%). Water moves continually through the water cycle of
                evaporation,
                transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea.
